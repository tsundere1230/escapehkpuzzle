        You enter the restaurant and it's a bit like the usual restaurants you see. A bit messy,
        but also very homelike. Especially with the bright yellow light bulbs; they always give a
        sense of warmth.

        A.G. takes a seat next to another person in a hoodie. They (she? You have no idea anymore)
        also had a similar clothing style. A black hoodie and matching black tight pants, with
        gothic boots and a black choker. They had very long straight hair which was slightly highlighted
        blonde, and you were convinced they were a bass player out of a death metal band or something.

        Welcome to our little meeting. Our long waited moment. This is my partner, A.S., you can call
        him Siu. He is a very close friend of mine.

        Greetings! It is my utmost pleasure to meet you. A.G. has been telling you about me for
        forever! He had been blabbering about you all the time. Hey actually, before we discuss
        the reason why we are here, how about we order a bit of food first?
    </p>
    <p class="ag"><br>
        What a great idea! Oh, it's almost dinner time... I think we want two vegetarian dishes
        and two spicy dishes. Do you think you can handle that? Oh, and I'm allergic to pork.

        Here's the <a href="menu.jpg">menu</a>, don't be shy!
    </p>
    <p class="thinking"><br>
        Well it looks like you can't really get past these guys without ordering their favourite food.
        But it seems like the key word in each food is rubbed out or something... dammit. It would be
        helpful to figure out what each type of animal is called...
