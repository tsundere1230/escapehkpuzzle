    <p>Feels good to finally start the descent.</p>
    <p><br><br>It feels like a century since you've been up on this mountain. The scenery was great, but you
    really feel the need for a change of pace, back into urban life.</p>
    <p>
        <br><br>The descent is mostly quite flat, with a couple of wide stairs every once in a while, but then
        these really strange symbols appear on some signs. You quickly write them down in the order you saw them:

            <br>難田女山廿口手人弓一大十戈土火水木金月日
        <!-- This level has NOTHING to do with chicken! -->
        <br><br>But you feel like something's missing. It's almost like the list is ... incomplete?
