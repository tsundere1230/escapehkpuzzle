        At long last, you reach the fabled destination. Calm waves batter the sparkling sand once in a while.
        They aren't crashing over themselves and breaking, but rather, ripple their way in, and out. The sand
        looks pristine as ever, and rare on an early spring day, no one appears to be around. You suddenly
        lose your way as you walk on this helipad near the beach. It's almost like you forgot how you got there,
        and even worse, there doesn't seem to be a path forward. You look around, and a small piece of paper
        catches your eye.
