        You continue your trek and the air is as pleasing as ever. Perhaps you are really getting far away
        from the urban areas. You keep walking and the road is paved along the edge of the reservoir.
        It's so breezy here as well that you really don't want this trek to be over. But lately so many
        random obstacles have been in your path that you feel one might come up soon.

        And speaking of the devil, it's the most annoying kid in the world. And his damn rubik's cube.

    It will also make the solution a lot easier-->
