        Well it looks like, while you were trying to figure out the name of that piece, the time had already
        turned to midnight! And in the absence of the light, you see a little faint path that was obscured by
        the reflection of the sunlight earlier in the day. You sigh because it's such a careless move, but
        alas, you're on the beach. There's no one around, you think. Not even the rustling of grass. Just
        the calm waves.
    </p>

        You guess you have wait for the morning to find the phone. After all, it is not supposed to be easier
        to find things in the dark.
    </p>

    <p><br>
        You lay down on the sand and <a href="lookup.html"> look up.</a>
    </p>
