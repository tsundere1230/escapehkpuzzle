        Of course, you have to take bus number 94 to get closer to that place. You quickly board the bus and
        in literal seconds, the bus starts moving. You haven't even paid. Anyways, you quickly sit down
        and you find a newspaper on the chair next to you. Being the puzzle god that you are,
        you flip through it quickly and find a crossword of sorts. Well, what a way to pass the time, you think.
