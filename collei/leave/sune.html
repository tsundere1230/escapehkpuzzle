    <p><br>Wow! Thank you! </p>

    <p class="player"><br>Ok but can you just look up a guide next time?</p>

    <p><br>I do but I never remember!</p>

    <p class="player"><br>Excuses.</p>

        Hey! Well as thanks for you helping me so much, I'll tell you a bit about the next
        puzzle! It's to do with a ghost's arms, or limbs, or something like that.
    </p>

    <p class="player"><br>Oh alright, thanks.</p>

        The kid leaves and again, speaking of the devil, more obstacles come in your way.
        You just really can't get enough of these, huh. A weird energy is blocking the path, like
        some kind of invisible wall? But anyhow, the rock wall next to you seems to have some
        hints as to how to remove the wall.
