    <p>Lvl 21</p>
    <p><br>You've never been this excited to get back into the big city. According to your map.jpg, it's just a
    few steps from here.</p>
    <p>
        <br>You put away your phone and concentrate on the road in front of you.
        <br>You really want to just get to the town, but you're not really sure how.
        <br>There's no riddle in sight, but you just recalled that A.G. also texted
        <a href="colours.html"> this picture</a> to you while he called. Maybe he wants you to help figure
        something out?
