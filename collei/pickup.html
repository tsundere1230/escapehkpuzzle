            Greetings, its A.G. I see you have made it into the right district. Your puzzling abilities are no joke.
            Very well, you have earned the right to see me.
        </p>
    </span>
    <span class="thinking">
        <p>Wow, who does this guy think he is?</p>
    </span>
    <span class="ag"><p>
        When you get to the town centre, look for a small restaurant. I'll be there in a suit with an old guy
        wearing some hawaiian shirt or something. Be seeing you.
    </p></span>
    <span class="thinking"><p>
        Well at least that wasn't all in vain. You're finally meeting him. Let's quickly solve this level and
        move on.
