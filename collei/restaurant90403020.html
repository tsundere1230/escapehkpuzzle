        Hi darling, is anything the matter? The menu? Oh... let me see... well I can tell you there's
        exactly two non-spicy vegetarian dishes on the menu and three spicy dishes. But one of the
        spicy dishes contains pork, so your friends actually don't have a choice.

        Okay, thanks mum!
