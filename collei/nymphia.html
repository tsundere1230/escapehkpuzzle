    <p>Congratulations! You have found a sleeping Sylveon!</p>

<div class="story">
    <p style="color:#ff89d1">Hi!</p>
    <p><br> The Sylveon begins to speak.</p>
    <span class="thinking"><p><br>
        Now what?? Not only a Pokemon in the middle of the road, but also a talking one? You can't be making this up.
    </p></span>
    <p style="color:#ff89d1"><br>o I'm not actually a Pokemon! I'm just a hologram created by... I can't say that name,
    sorry.</p>
    <p><br>The sylveon appears to stutter and shake a little.</p>
    <span class="player"><p><br>
        Well okay, uh, Sylveon. What brings you to this location?
    </p></span>
    <p style="color:#ff89d1"><br>
        Nothing much really! I just really wanted to tell you that there were secret/s in the B folder!
    </p>
    <span class="player"><p><br>
        Secrets? Like what, the color of my underwear?
    </p></span>
    <p style="color:#ff89d1"><br>
        No, silly! I mean secret levels or secret items. Have you ever guessed something so unreasonable that you
        laughed at yourself afterwards? Well have no fear because sometimes obscene guesses give you good things!
        I'll even be so kind and tell you, I'm not the only secret in this folder! Goodbye!
    </p>
    <p><br>
        The Sylveon fades and disappears. Well that was super weird.
        <br>(This is a dead end. Please go back to the page you were on)
