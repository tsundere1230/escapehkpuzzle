        You order the appropriate food and it arrives very quickly.
    </p>
    <p class="ag"><br>
        Right, let's get on with why we are here. As you may know, there have been cases of the strange
        radio signal being emitted from the Southern side of the land.
    </p>
    <p class="as"><br>
        In fact, it is in Wan Chai, although we don't really know where in Wan Chai exactly. Here, let me
        pin it on your <a href="map.html">map</a> for you. What we also know is that someone is controlling
        this radio signal's broadcast time and duration. We don't really know the factors that cause it
        to go off, but it has been shown to be more frequent during the day.
    </p>
    <p class="ag"><br>
        And as you know, once you come into contact with the signal without appropriate protection, you seem to
        lose sentience, or something like that. The effects aren't very long-lasting, perhaps only for about
        four to six hours, but we have received intel that it's only a matter of time that the severeness
        or the duration of the effect will worsen.
    </p>
    <p class="player"><br>
        And what exactly constitutes appropriate protection?
    </p>
    <p class="as"><br>
        Great question, so far we have identified that ear plugs work, for some reason. Being indoors is also a
        very good idea, and other than that, we have not discovered anything effective.
    </p>
    <p class="player"><br>
        But hold on, there's still something I don't understand. Why is it that you've summoned me? And what
        is it that I, or we, have to do?
    </p>
    <p class="as"><br>
        You have asked a question worthy of a million dollars. </p>

    <p class="story"><br>he chuckles lightly, and the pitch of his voice rises by about five semitones.</p>

    <p><br>
        The answer to the first question will be quite apparent very soon. You must continue your journey
        to find out. I won't elaborate on that. You'll have to figure it out for yourself. As for
        the second, it is quite simple, although we can't dump all of our motives on the table right away. You
        have proven to be trustworthy, but this is a life or death operation. Tell you what, actually A.G.
        has lost his phone recently. He is very sure of the location of it, since we have a very general-area
        GPS tracker. It is on one of the four great beaches - Ham Tin Wan. Tell you what, if you help him recover
        his phone, we'll bring you to our base of operations. We'll be able to uncover a lot more than what we can
        here. Alas, we are in a public area. Who knows if there are spies around. Hahaha!
    </p>
    <p class="player"><br>
        Another place to the east where the sea meets the sky? <span class="thinking">How uncouth.</span>
        Wait, why not just rush to Wan Chai then?
    </p>
    <p class="ag"><br>
        No, that would be very risky. Besides, we'd rather plan a more methodical attack.
    </p>
    <p class="player"><br>
        Fine. Let us head off then.
    </p>
    <p class="ag"><br>
        Us? Sorry, but we cannot accompany you there. There is a little something else we must do...
    </p>
    <p class="as"><br>
        Oh don't tell them about it. That's more secretive than all of our official operations...
    </p>
    <p class="thinking"><br>
        Suspicious.
