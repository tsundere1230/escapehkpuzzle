        At long last, you reach the beach, Ham Tin Wan. It really has been one of the longest treks
        of your life. You crouch down and scoop a heap of sand, and you feel each grain of soft sand
        drizzle its way between your fingers and onto the ground like in an hourglass.
    </p>

    <p><br>
        You're busy minding your own business when a man in a black suit approaches you. Oh, it's A.G.
        Hm, what happened to his thigh highs? But you suppose it would be difficult to hike in those.
    </p>

    <p class="ag"><br>
        Ah, we meet again. Here, I found my phone just on the way! I really want to show you this picture
        of a cute dog I saw along the way, but I forgot my password... do you think you can help me
        remember?
    </p>

    <p class="player"><br>
        How am I supposed to do that? <!-- by saying the song -->
    </p>

    <p class="ag"><br>
        I don't know! I'm so sorry!
    </p>
    <p class="story"><br>He definitely sounds sorry. He then proceeds
        to sit down and mumbles to himself.</p>

    <p class="ag"><br>I can't leave you... alone...</p>
    <p class="story">, he starts, </p>
    <p class="ag">when I close my eyes...</p>
    <p class="story"><br>
        *then he sings in language you don't understand*<br>
        Well, you're on your own now.
