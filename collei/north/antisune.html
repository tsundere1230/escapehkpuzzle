    <p><br>Wow! Thank you! </p>

    <p class="player"><br>Ok but can you just look up a guide next time?</p>

    <p><br>I do but I never remember!</p>

        Hey! Well as thanks for you helping me so much, I'll tell you a bit about the next
        puzzle! It's to do with these strange symbols! They're all over the place!
    </p>

    <p class="thinking"><br>That's as useless as telling me theres a puzzle.</p>

    <p class="player"><br>Alright then, thank you.</p>

    <p><br>
        You really hope you never see this kid again. He's so tiring to deal with. And just as
        you are beginning to feel tired, a small resting spot appears - there's a little bench
        and a big sign that tells you about forest fires. But of interest to you is the carvings
        on the bench. You quickly write down the symbols carved into the bench.
