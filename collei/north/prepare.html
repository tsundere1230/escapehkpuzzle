        Ah, we meet again. I was actually here because I wanted to try and find the phone with you.
        I have left A.S. as we had finished the most important duties. Now, he is heading back to the
        headquarters first, while we look for my phone.

    <p class="player"><br>
        Great, but do you know how to get there? Also, how are you going to hike in these thigh highs?

        ...

        Don't mind the thigh highs... it's part of my personality.

        But in fact, I do know how to get there. That is of more use to us than deliberating about my thigh
        highs. I have received information that someone had deliberately moved my phone to a place where
        the sky truly meets the sea: Cheung Tsui! Do you know where that is? Open up your map, and it's the
        eastern most point on land. Whoever did this must be planning something. We must be extremely careful.
    </p>
    <p class="player"><br>
        Sure, I'm ready. And I won't inquire about the thigh highs, but the grass around these parts are
        quite sharp.
