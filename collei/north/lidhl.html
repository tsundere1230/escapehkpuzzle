        That doesn't really make much sense to you, but nevermind. You then try to leave the shelter
        since you're worried the sun would set if you take too long. But you can't since something is
        literally blocking your way. You can't see anything, but you can't leave. <br><br>
        You think that's really strange until you see a new pattern on the roof of the shelter. You have
        to quickly copy it down again.
