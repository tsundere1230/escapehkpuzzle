        You see it in the distance now. The beach that A.G. and A.S. told you about. It should be not long
        before you get to meet them again and discuss plans to reach Wan Chai. There seems to be one last
        obstacle in your way before you can sink your feet into the inviting, sandy beach. It's another
        <a href="puzzleof29.html"> puzzle</a>, what a bother.
