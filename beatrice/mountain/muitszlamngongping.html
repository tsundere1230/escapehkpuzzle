    <p>Wow, the scenery! This is a sight to behold! It's so relaxing here that you could spend all day
    gazing at the fine silvergrass that cover the plateau in a silky, golden-brown hue. A few small insects
    catch your eye as they hop from grass to grass; petal to petal...</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>This scene is so serene that you can't help but sit there in awe. It's like a paradise on Earth, really.
    Birds are flocking around and people are also like birds... what? No, you're sure they're just paragliding.
    You really want to play some music right now but you really don't know what to play. After all, so many
    kinds of music would fit this scenery.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>You think hard but, an old man walks past with his radio pretty damn loud. You hear his
        <a href="musicof19.html">music</a> pretty faintly in the background. The name of the song is at the
        top of your head, but you really want to know the composer's name to check out their other stuff.</p>
