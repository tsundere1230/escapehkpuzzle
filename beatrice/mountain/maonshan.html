    <p>You continue onwards and up the mountain. You're not sure what to think about this because
    you haven't done exercise in so long. After all, you're an unathletic shut in. This mountain
    is really damn tall and there's no way you're climbing it in one go. One thing you do know is
    that you don't have to climb to the top. As long as you reach that ridge up there, you're
    sure you could find your way down and into the next area. But you can't do that if you don't
    even know where you are currently.</p> <!-- where are you?-->
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>You're at the end of a really steep road, that's all you know.</p>
