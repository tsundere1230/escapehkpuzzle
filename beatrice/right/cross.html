        You suddenly remember that your physics teacher told you that the reason why you have two eyes
        is that you can tell how far objects are away from you. <!--it's called?--> But you can't really do
        that since you see that the mountains in the distance have gotten exactly 0.0cm bigger in your field
        of vision since your last time checking. It's almost like you made no progress at all.
