    You're almost there. The place where the sea meets the sky in the east. But you're not facing east
    right now, you're damn sure this 'sea' or inlet is facing north. Nevertheless, you're so close to
    A.G.'s meeting place, you can feel his presence from here.
</p>
<p>
    <br> You're really unsure why the mall asked you for that mathematical object. Who has time
    for pure maths? <!-- jokes aside, its great until your wallet is dead -->
</p>
<p>
    <br> You're tired. So tired. After all, you've walked (or taken the train, if you took the lazy path)
    so far from home. Yet A.G. is nowhere to be seen, still. You would really like to speed things up,
    but it looks like you're blocked again from the next area. A guard from up ahead stops you in your tracks.
</p>
<span class="npc"><p>
    <br> Stop right there, you suspicious fellow. Why do you plan to leave this district?
</p></span>
<span class="player"><p>
    <br> Uh what do you mean? Why can't I just walk wherever I please?
</p></span>
<span class="npc"><p>
    <br> You don't understand. This is an urgent state-wide lockdown. Have you not heard of the dangerous radio signal?
</p></span>
<span class="player"><p>
    <br> Oh yeah, I forgot about that. What exactly does it do to you?
</p></span>
<span class="npc"><p>
    <br> The unspeakable horror! I know one person who was outside without protection when the signal came into effect.
    It's almost like he forgot who he was and started acting differently! No malicious actions, but it was just strange,
    that's all. He recovered a while later and returned to normal, but something tells me this signal will only
    become more frequent as time goes by. You should stay alert, young one.
</p></span>
<span class="player"><p>
    <br> I understand sir, and thank you for your information. I really don't want to make a fuss, but I'm supposed to meet
    a person called A.G. in the next district. I have to go. I've gone so far already.
</p></span>
<span class="npc"><p>
    <br> Oh, then you must be...! Sorry, I was just talking to myself. Please do pass. He did tell me that you were
    coming, and that you needed a secret word to show you were worthy of meeting him.
    So, friend of A.G.'s, you must have seen the paper in the mall just now. Tell me, what would you have if you
    removed axiom 2 and 3? Enter the answer after the word group, like /groupset.html!
