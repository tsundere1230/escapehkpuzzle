    <p>Oh, that museum was so weird. How on Earth was Oscar Wilde even related?</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Anyhow, you continue on and discover this large park.</p>
    <p>It's very tranquil, with birds everywhere and the elderly doing their morning tai chi exercise.
    Ah, what a sight to behold, or as the kids say these days, it's really 'based'. <br>
