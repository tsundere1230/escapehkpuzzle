    <p>You enter a large train station, the Tai Wai station. Ah, just the place you were
    hoping to find A.G. in.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Just then, a (incredibly) loud speaker bellows:</p>
    <span clas="ag"><p>
        Ohohoho. If you hear this, you are on the right track.
        I will meet you at a place where the sky meets the sea, somewhere very far east
        from here. When you find me, I'll be in in a black suit. You definitely can't
        miss me. Good luck!
    </p></span></p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <span class="thinking"><p>What?</p></span>
    <p> </p>
    <p>You can't possibly be distracted by that right now though. This station is incredibly
    big and has two floors.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>Why don't you go check out the <a href="upperfloor.html">second</a> floor?</p>

    <p>Well look at you, you've made it to the Beatrice folder.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Now you're on your own! Good luck!</p>
