        You arrive at a weird... exit? <em>I mean, you're trying to</em>, but what on Earth
        is this door? Why aren't stations just built the way they are supposed to be, y'know,
        open aired and all?
    </p>
    <p>
        Anyways, you look a little closer at the door. It says: <a href="listen.html">"listen"</a>
    </p>
    <p>
        Well you're trying your best.
