        So you really didn't know
        what was going on, but you manage to convince them that you don't really want to be
        informed of horse racing. After all, your
        mum told you to never gamble.
    </p>
    <p>
        Anyways, you recall A.G.'s message that they wanted you to
        check up with them at a
        region where the sky meets the sea, in the far east. You pull
        out a pocket <a href="map.jpg">map</a> of the area. You're very positive that they are
        somewhere in the
        Sai Kung district.</p>

    <p>
        Things get a bit complicated because when you look out from the horizon here, it seems to
        be the case that you have to cross the bridge to be able to reach the east coast. Going forward
        here won't be useful to you at all.
        <!-- you will eventually get there, but not from this level, so ignore it-->
    </p>
    <p>
        You want to cross now, but the footbridge is closed.
