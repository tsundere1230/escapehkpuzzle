    <p>Lvl 13</p>
    <p>Now that level number was definitely off!</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>You pick up some food in the market. You're damn sure you need to make food now, since you're so hungry.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>You want two slices of bread with butter and peanut butter, and definitely another two with jam.</p>
    <p>Your mum probably wants one more each of the two cheapest (non-bread) things, since they're on discount.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Food costs: $2 / slice of bread (why would anyone sell per slice...)</p>
    <p>$18 / peanut butter</p>
    <p>$28 / butter tub</p>
    <p>$33 / maple syrup</p>
    <p>$42 / honey</p>
    <p>$16 / jam</p>
    <p>$14 / mars bar</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>You proceed to grab the foods and check them out.</p>
    <p>You've been told you get 10% off as a member. Yay!</p>
