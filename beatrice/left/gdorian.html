        You're outdoors again! You discover a large museum, but you're not sure how to avoid
        the staff, since you know you're going to be so late to the meeting with A.G.
        (thus you can't afford a museum visit right now).<!--btw what's the title of this page?-->
    </p>
    <p>
        One member of the staff walks up to you and hands you a brochure of the latest display.
    </p>
    <p>
        You need to convince them you know stuff. Fast.
