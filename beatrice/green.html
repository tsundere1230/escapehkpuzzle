        You're now closing in on 'where the sea meets the sky'. But from your <a href="map.jpg">map</a> you're so
        sure that you have to get somewhere across that mountain, or ridge, or whatever.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
        It looks like you can <a href="continue.html">continue walking</a>
        around the northern coast, or you could take the
        <a href="mountain/name.html">shorter but more dangerous route</a> up the mountain.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
        It's your choice really.

        Tsundere: Well good job on making it this far. This level is supposed to be accessible regardless
        of which fork (Left/Right) you solved. I.e. the forks merge here. You won't know that unless you solved
        both forks. (or, well, if I tell you) Starting in the next folder, I won't be so nice. You won't even know
        unless you pick up certain hints. Generally, the more forks you do, the more knowledge you have about
        the story/game. That being said, no one's stopping you from playing the game as you like it.
