    Ah yes, you're absolutely filled from that tofu pudding. You can't really put your finger on it,
    (I mean you can, literally) but you really like how that brown sugar melts into the tofu.
    Anyhow, you're prepared to move on and get around that mountain for once.

    That's all fine and all until you stumble across a park. The grass is green and everything,
    all the birds are chirping, it's just a lovely day in general.
    You really can't see any reason not to stop and take a longer break. I mean, you've been walking
    for a good 5-6 hours.
</p>
<p>
    <br> You really wanted to but as you find the best seat in the whole park, it starts raining.
</p>
<p class="thinking">
    <br> Really? That coincidentally?, you think to yourself.
</p>
<p>
    <br> The last thing you want is to be caught in the wind and rain, so you hurry over to the next
    place you can rest. One reasonable thing to do is just go inside a building, like a mall or
    something.
</p>
<p>
    <br> This isn't until the mall right in front of you is locked, with a stupid sign in front.
