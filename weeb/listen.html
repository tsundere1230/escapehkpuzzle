        The forest continues a little longer and a trail that is exposed on all sides soon slips into the
        horizon. The path continues up and, menacingly, a very sharp mountain stands in front of you.
    </p>
    <p class="ag"><br>
        It's the tallest mountain around these parts, Sharp Peak. It's quite aptly named, don't you think?
        Also, do you have any idea how to get up there?
