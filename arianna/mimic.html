        Well you continue your way to the meeting place, across the street, and you see a market
        so you decide to go in and see what's good.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
        The bloody smell of meat and the fishy smell of ... fish. Amazing.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
        Also there seems to be a lot of snacks available. You really want one of
        <a href="yumyum.html">those</a> <!-- type of bread! -->
        , but you just can't remember the name of it.
    </a>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
        If only you could tell the shopkeeper what you wanted. <!-- mind the level number! -->
