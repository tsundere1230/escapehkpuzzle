        Eh... "octopus," you
        said, and you
        climbed, or went
        atop, perhaps, the weirdest bridge you've ever seen.
        Looking from the bottom, it didn't even feel like it was
        an octopus,
        though it does have
        eight 'legs', or, er ... 'bridges'.

        You can barely see what's in front of you. A large river, a station, and a lot of buildings (of course).
        But you don't know how to get to the next area, I mean, folder.

        Ok, it's me for the last time. I'll introduce two more concepts before I don't have to hold your hand.
        They are called 'combinations' (un/pw) and 'forking'.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
        Combinations: some answers have multiple parts. (Like other riddle games, they are called 'username/password' levels)
        In EscapeHK, you will ALWAYS be prompted to enter slashes between them, like this: john/coltrane.html (example)
        Basically, this means that if you aren't told to put a slash, you shouldn't put a slash.
        And if you are told things about un/pw's or slashes, then you know what to do.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
        Forking: Sometimes there are multiple correct solutions to a level, and they lead you to two different levels. That is a 'fork'.
        This is not the same thing a combination, since you only need one fork to continue, technically.
    </p>
    <p>
        Although it is wise to explore all forks, so you can get as many hints as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
        Most of the time, you can solve a level without knowing a fork existed, or two different levels could be solved and lead to the same level and you wouldn't know.
    </p>
    <p>
        Luckily for you, Arianna (or A) folder does not have any forks. :)
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <!-- for the second half, you need an anagram from levels 6-7 -->
    <!-- an anagram is a rescrambling of letters. -->
    <!-- so an anagram of the word 'anagram' could be 'aaagmnr' or 'margana' or ... you get what I mean -->
    <!-- obviously your answer should be an actual word/words -->
    <p>
        This is the last level of the tutorial, so if you solve this, it means you understand fully how to play.
        And like any good tutorial, what better way to use the things you've just learnt!
        This level is a un/pw AND fork! If you swap the order of the un and pw, you get the second fork.
        I'm so kind, right? Enjoy my bountiful generosity for a grand total of 1 more level. :)
    </p>

        Don't ask about the real world implications of body doubling (forking)!
