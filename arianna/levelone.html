            Ah. Just another fine morning. You wake up, but you find that the streets are awfully quiet. You stretch a
            little, and the sounds of the birds are as pleasant as ever. You open the curtains and beams of pure yellow
            flood your room.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
            You hear a faint "AHH!" from just outside. You are positive your mum isn't home, since she's on vacation in
            Thailand. So who could it be? Or was it from your neighbours? Strange, because it certainly isn't a voice you recognise.
            But when you reach up to open the door, you find that you are locked in your own room.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
            You're in a panic. You've never locked your door, so how was it possible you were locked inside? If only
            you could calm down and think about where you left the key.
        </p>

            If you see this text, hi, its me (Tsundere), the creator of the game EscapeHK.
            Just a few things about riddle games to guide you if you are new. If you have
            played other web riddle games before, some of these things will be familiar to you, but don't skip!
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
            Most of the time, you'll want to solve the riddle by changing the url.
            Currently it is ' ... /arianna/levelone.html'.
        </p>
        <p>
            As part of the solution, you should only ever use the lower case a-z, 0-9, and slashes (you can
            ignore them for now, more on slashes on level 8).
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
            The 'arianna' part is the folder and 'levelone' is the url of the level.
            You can ignore the actual name of the folder. It could have said 'aaron' for example, and function the same
            way. Each district of the real map of HK has its own folder, mostly. I say mostly because certain, more
            crowded districts will get multiple folders. 'Arianna' is technically the tutorial folder, and "Shatin"
            district (the district you're in now) is the B folder.) It goes without saying that you don't *need* any
            prior knowledge of anything, although it could certainly help in some situations.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
            Anyways, to solve the riddle, you will want to check everything in a level. Granted, this is easier said
            than done.
        </p>
        <p>
            But since this is the first level, I'll be nice. Answer this question: what's five plus five?
