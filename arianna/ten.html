        Good job! You count to ten, and after calming down, try to remember where you put your key.

        Unfortunately you still haven't found it. How could you be so forgetful? You do remember, though, that
        you have voice recognition software on your phone. But it doesn't really ring a bell what you're supposed to say.

        Hi, its Tsundere again.
    </p>
    <p>
        The game will get harder very soon, so fasten your seatbelts. Especially on mobile. I should go ahead
        and say if you are using anything other than a computer, it's best to swap now.
    </p>

        Write down everything you see! Things you don't think are useful now could be very useful later.
        Old levels could also be very useful for later <!-- and this level's --> solutions
        You are also advised to make a map of how each area connects to the next, and all the URLs.
        "Saving" is not a thing in riddle games, because as long as you remember the last URL, you can just
        pick it up there tomorrow. Don't rely on browsing history! Write it down!!!!!
        You will thank me later.
    </p>

        Something else you also want to know is how to check the source code! Pressing F12 (or Fn+F12 on Mac) will
        get you there. Something like Ctrl+U could work too, or right clicking the page and select 'view-source'.
        <!-- yes if you see this, you're doing the right thing. -->
        <!-- what page have you not checked the source code for? -->
