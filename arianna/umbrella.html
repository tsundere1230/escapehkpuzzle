        Ah, the streets, how you miss them. The sky, too, was nothing like before.
        It was clear, a pristine azure blue, although a few clouds tarnished its purity.
        Well the clouds were pretty too, you think.

    <p>
        Just then, you are greeted by a large man, probably in his forties or fifties.

            Ey. Youngster, can you help me out here?
    </p></span>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <span class="player"><p>
            Hey, uh sure. What do you need help with?
    </p></span>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <span class="uf"><p>
            That's good to hear. Recently my grandson asked me to play this game... I'm not sure how
              to play it but he told me about his favourite monster... but I'm old and grey, I've
              forgotten the name of it.
    </p></span>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <span class="thinking"><p>
        Wait grandson? This guy is like 50?!
    </p></span>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <span class="player"><p>
            Ok man, what do I need to do? What do you remember of it?
    </p></span>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <span class="uf"><p>
            I've written some notes down here, but, oof ... my memory is dry ...
              I just know its a cute one, but also very scary...
    </p></span>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <span class="thinking"><p>
        Wow, you couldn't be any more helpful could you.
    </p></span>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
        Well, you're stuck here now.
