        'Sap'! You said. Ah, of course, the voice recognisation software wasn't coded to understand English.

            Good morning, you got a piece of mail today. Why don't you read it?
              It said something about meeting at the Tai Wai station.

        Good job! As the level number (on the screen) was written in Chinese characters, you should expect the answer to be in jyutping.
        There won't be many levels like that. You will also never need the tones, so please disregard them.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can sometimes interact with the picture in the level to find things.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here there are two things you can click on, the letter or the fridge. You can also see the links in
        the html source code, so don't worry about having to hover over everything to get it.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
        And as a rule again, write down everything you see!
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
        Last tip from me for now, you can 'call' other characters with their number.
        To call them, add their phone number to the end of the url.
        You must also call them on a certain level (e.g. sap90403020, or ten90403020).
    </p>
    <p>
        You can also check whether you have the right number by calling them on the main folder, like this:
        escapehk.surge.sh/90403020.html . This is so that you can confirm the number actually exists.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some characters speak more than others! If they don't respond, it means they are not available.
        As a general rule, any character can speak to you at most once per five levels.
        <!-- 5 level numbers, so including forks-->
        <!-- They also respond once per level number. You'll get what I mean later.-->
