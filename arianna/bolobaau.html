        Of course, i<!---->t<!---->'s a Bo Lo Baau (pineapple bread)!

        You pay for one quickly and leave the marke<!---->t<!---->, because you really can't stand the smell of fish.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
        In typical HK fashion, you pace rapidly down the street as you munch the bread. Wouldn't want to
        be late to such an important(?) meeting.

        Things just aren't going your way today though - the traffic lights are all out of order, meaning they
        can flash on and off independently of one another. You'd think the local transportation officers would
        come and fix it, but well, they haven't. And worse, the footbridge is bloody locked. Your best bet is to
        just cross anyway like an insane person would. From your observation, there are two sets of car traffic
        lights, they are green for 10 and 15 seconds while being red for 15 and 20 (respectively).
    </p>
    <p>
        You're also positive that the first one just turned <!---->r<!---->ed, and the second just turned green.
        You're thinking how long you should wait. <!--answer in numbers, like 35 (seconds) -->

    <!--Go do the math, I'm not giving you a hint lol-->
